Angular Routing:
In a single-page application, we need to refresh the portion of a single page only to show the content from a specific component rather than refresh the whole page.
Angular components provide multiple views and to handle navigation from one view to the next, we use Angular Router. 
The router will enable us to navigate from one view to another by refreshing the area/portion that is defined by using <router-outlet>.
-	We need to first define the router mapping. [ Path[URL] ------ Component ]
-	Use Router Link to Navigate to the path
-	Component will be refreshed to the area assigned with Router-Outlet
