class Test
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		Two.main(a);		
	}
}

class Two 
{
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		System.out.println(a[0]);	
	}
}


Could not find or load main class


A.class
A a1=A.getInstance();

8 - What is the difference between Final, Finalize and Finally? 

Final: is a key word is used with variable , class and method to apply restrictions , it prevent variable to be Reasigned and prevent class to be inhirted and prevent method to be overrided
Finally: it's block of code used to excute important code wether exception handeled or not
Fainalize: it's a method used to performe clean up processing just before object is  garbage collected

9 - what is the problem

class Test
{
private Test(){}
	
}
class Two  extends Test
{
	
	public static void main(String a[])
	{
		new Two();	
	}
}




Implicit super constructor Test() is not visible for default constructor. 
Must define an explicit constructor



10 - q37 image answer B




11 - what's the difference between  equals method and hashcode method?
Equals: Determines if the objects are exactly equalvalent 
// hashcode gets the memory location of the variable in stack.
  // == is the default for .equals and it compares the hash code of the two variables
hashcode value can be changed in multiple execution in the same application but equal method don't , 
when two object are equal in equal method thatâ€™s mean their hashcode must be same



	static String s="cogent";
	static String s1="cogent";
	static String s2=new String("cogent"); 
	static String s3=new String("cogent"); 

	System.out.println(s==s1);				true
	System.out.println(s.equals(s1));			true
	System.out.println(s==s2);				false
	System.out.println(s.equals(s2));			true
	System.out.println(s2==s3);				false
	System.out.println(s2.equals(s3));			true
	System.out.println(s2.hashCode()==s3.hashCode());	true 
	cause hashCode had been overriden



12-What is the difference  between Error and Exception? Checked vs Unchecked?

Error- Java comiles errors 
 Exception- runtime errors that occurs when code executes.  
can prevent crashes with try and catch block

errors are unchecked type it's indicate there is some serious problem and shouldn't be catsh
Exception unchecked error - runtime it's indicate that we have some issue with the code that our code try to do something 
it cann't do like ArrayIndexOutOfBound we can call it programmer error we can avoid it by write better code
checked Exception -Compile time it's happining during runtime we can use try and catsh like FileNotFoundException.



13 -is finally always executable
yes, unless the System forced shutdown in try block
system.exit();
